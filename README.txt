Setup: 1: you need to install pip if you haven't already(you can skip this if you want but i'd recommend it), 
          if you dont replace 'pip' with 'sudo apt-get install'
       2: pip install virtualenv
       3: virtualenv flask
       4: ./setup.txt(you may need to change permissions)
       5: next do, source flask/bin/activate (this starts the enviornment)
       5: ./run.py to run the app
